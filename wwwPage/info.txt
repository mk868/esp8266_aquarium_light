to clarify: I like to use DDNS with local ip addresses. It's easy to use, it always works (I had problems with mDNS) and it's safe (the device is available only in the local network)...

This page is used instead of the DDNS server.
Actually, it's an iframe on the webpage that points to the local esp8266 IP...
